I am a Data Science Practitioner with several years of experience in statistics, data analysis, data engineering, and machine learning.

As a Data Analyst for three different organizations, I have always furthered my education through reading new materials and creating projects. I learned how to use GPT-3â€™s API to create software to standardize several reports which were delivered to 10+ clients. My passion for technology has been repeatedly recognized by the organizations that I have worked for.

Some of the tasks that I take the most pride in include the following:
- Data migration in ETL/ELT processes
- Conducting data-heavy research for lengthy reports
- Analyzing technical documentation and then teaching others how to use the technology I read about
- Training staff in data analysis, data quality, and data management techniques
- Incorporating Bayesian statistics into my workflow
